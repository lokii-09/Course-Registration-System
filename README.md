# Course-Registration-System
This is a simple one-page website showcasing a terminal-based Course Registration System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming and STL. The system simulates a real academic enrollment portal with support for:

Adding students and courses

Managing prerequisites

Handling enrollment with capacity limits

Maintaining waitlists

Automatic enrollment from waitlists after drop

Preventing time slot conflicts

This website serves as a portfolio presentation of the C++ project, with explanations, features, sample inputs/outputs, and links to the GitHub source code and live demo.
